## MARVLS 4 Gonad Histology Review QA/QC Exercise ![wordcloud](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iB02uhQ-Z2BEziCao1HKZiYgbmLvOxJNgq6VOZ7FHZ0NFw0cmoHfiR35MUeO7lRkgGBNkvW49zdOJyZUbbsEV_oVirzLJFx4Gr5vK05wS7phRycwZlHOpU92YonsxEGmh8LJSJ3Nrsxo37QvEIQ-n_jm1YhOsTz1mPRhVd3_W3vx9VGmbaksD-tCnWJJww)

Word cloud of data recorded for the 1,694 reads on 149 fish by 18 participants. Larger text indicates terms recorded more frequently, smaller text represents terms reported less frequently.  Text from the comment field was not included in this summary.  Not surprisingly, since all fish evaluated were iteroparous females, primary growth oocyte (PG) was the most common feature recorded.    

**Overview/summary**

Thank you to all who participated in this QA/QC effort by either submitting images for review, reviewing images or both. Despite the postponement of the 4th MARVLS workshop, we hope this exercise is still a valuable learning experience for all participants and that these efforts will guide future discussions on histological techniques and evaluation.    

A total of fourteen people submitted images of 22 species for this effort.  Contributors to this effort were: Katie Anweiler, Nancy Brown‐Peterson, Christina Conrath, Teresa Fish, Keilin Gamboa‐Salazar, Lyndsey Lefebvre, Richard McBride, Yvonna Press, Erin Reed, Eva Schemmel, Emilee Tholke, Carrie Worton, Mark Wuenschel, and David Wyanski. A total of eighteen people evaluated gonad histology images from 149 fish of 22 species for this effort. Contributors to this effort were: Katie Anweiler, Veronica Beech, Nancy Brown‐Peterson, Christina Conrath, Teresa Fish, Keilin Gamboa‐Salazar, Melissa Head, Kevin Kolmos, Lyndsey Lefebvre, Richard McBride, Susanne McDermott, Yvonna Press, Erin Reed, Eva Schemmel, Emilee Tholke, Carrie Worton, Mark Wuenschel, and David Wyanski. 

A total of 1,694 histology reads of 149 fish gonad samples were evaluated, recording 10,684 features. 

The data for each individual fish have been collated and are available in the MARVLS Shared Drive: MARVLS_SharedDrive/Workshop 4 2020/Gonad Histology QA/QC/Individual Species Collations.  Each evaluator has been given an anonymous reader number.  To determine your reader number open a collated file for one of your submissions, the reader number associated with a "yes" under the 'Your Slide?' column is your number.  If this is unclear, please contact Christina and she will provide you your number.   

**Analysis‐ compilation and summary of reads.**

This initial view of the data collected is largely qualitative, and attempts to summarize patterns in the interpretation of histological images.  The format for this exercise (variable numbers of digital images per fish, at variable magnifications) had its limitations and challenges. However, most people were able to make determinations that they were reasonably confident in (medium to high confidence).    

Heat maps were chosen for these summaries to illustrate patterns in agreement across readers, and are not meant to evaluate individuals per se.  In that sense, we hope points of disagreement indicated can serve as areas to discuss (we planned to do this at the MARVLS 4 meeting that was postponed). In this summary, we treat all readers as the same, and anonymously. The exception being in some summaries where we considered the person submitting the fish images as an expert and their read as an 'answer key' as explained below.    

These summary plots do not consider any notes written in the comment field. Participants recorded a lot of additional information in the comment field, and we encourage people to look at those in the individual species collated data sheets. Individual reads are all also available for further review and exploration as people desire. There are many possible ways to summarize the data collected from all of the individual reads that either include or ignore information from the person submitting the slide (treat that as an 'answer key').  For this initial evaluation, we have summarized the data in the following three ways:

1‐ All reads, no 'answer key', just percent reads that listed each structure 

2‐ All reads, with 'answer key', and percent agreement to the 'answer key' 

3‐ Medium and High confidence reads only, with 'answer key', and percent agreement to the 'answer key' 

Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages, summarized below:

\*Low confidence may be due to reader inexperience or image quality.   

Since each summarization approach has its own value, we have opted to provide all of them in this review.    

For each approach, the list of 149 Fish IDs was split into 4 plots for viewing, so there are 4 plots per summary approach, and a  total of 12 plots. 

For approach 3, we excluded reads with low or blank confidence (n= 235 of 1694 total reads).   

The average number of reads per fish was 8.8, most fish had \>6 reads, but 3 had 4 or less. Some fish with low numbers of reads may have been marginal quality images so many readers listed confidence as low. More information for these Fish_IDs will appear in summary approaches 1 and 2 that include all data. 

For approaches 2 and 3, the read from the submitter was treated as the 'answer key'. In most cases, people submitted fish/slides they were confident in, so we felt this was a reasonable assumption for analysis. This is why the high confidence (CONF_H) column is green for most fish (the submitter had high confidence), and the med confidence (CONF_M) column is red (many readers had medium confidence). We recognize that in some cases people submitted fish/slides they were not highly confident in.    

Heat maps were created to show which characters were identified for each individual fish. In the case of approaches 2 and 3, the heat maps show the percent (proportion) agreement between the answer key and the readers. In these cases, the percent agreement was calculated as the proportion of readers who

listed a given feature (# instances/#reads) for each slide. If the submitter (answer key) also listed this, then this number is assigned positive value, if not it is assigned negative value, to center the scale on zero.  Where 1 = total agreement between all readers and the answer key, and ‐1 = all readers saw something that wasn't on the answer key.    

**Interpretation of the heatmap plots**

‐Green values indicate readers saw the same feature as the submitter, the darker the green, the greater proportion of readers agreed with the submitter. 

‐Red values indicate the readers saw a feature that the submitter didn't list, the darker the red, the greater proportion of readers saw this feature. 

‐White or blank space indicates neither the reader nor the submitter saw or listed this feature for this fish.   

These summary plots provide a means to evaluate patterns in agreement/disagreement.  For example, are there certain structures (columns) that are more problematic (e.g. CA vs. OD, V2 vs. V3). Or, are there certain species or fish that seem to have greater uncertainty (rows).   

**Next steps...**

It would be useful to have the individuals who submitted fish images to look at their images and try to annotate them to point out the structures they recorded. If, upon revisiting these images or after looking at the reads of others, there are additional structures you think should be recorded, please do so. 

This annotated set of images, and resulting reads and summaries can serve as practice or learning set, and assuming everyone is okay with this we might consider putting this exercise up on the website? 

To annotate your images, please use the duplicated images in the "ANNOTATED" folder in the shared Google Drive (full path: MARVLS_SharedDrive, Workshop 4: 2020, Gonad Histology QA/QC, Images, ANNOTATED) \*\*See italicized note below. 

● Double click on an image to open it in the Drive (background will be black, see blurry image below). In the top right corner, click "Add a comment" (icon similar to this: ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZLoQW8Zz3wWFVVIeYb4muk34pBSXsldhPqqe7rw6HzXvdmIvEJKJsMpu0TugUYWXe3qHG7H7GjFj495n5vALIWmP7FEqte6N5W8PMRS5RAmSSjmziuBlgM9p0jq8RljU1f6_FcD1g6a-TZO5HLOH31JnCOhJ8qgLd_dHB-YUijPyURahJ2chC8KYEdStPQ)  ). ● Click and drag to highlight the structure of interest with yellow box. 

● A dialogue box should pop up for you to type in the character (see the Eopsetta jordani folders for examples).   

● You do not need to annotate every structure in every image, just make sure each character you recorded is marked on at least one image.

\*\* Please note that it is not possible to copy the contents of a folder in Google Drive. The work around was imperfect, and there are likely missing images in the folders for individual fish. If you can identify all necessary structures in the images present, there is no need to do the following. Otherwise, please go to 

the original folder for your fish in the Gonad Histology QA/QC, Images folder. Highlight/select the missing image(s) (use CTRL to select multiple). Right click and select "Make a copy". Highlight/select the copied images (names of the file will be "Copy of original file name"); right click and select "Move to". When the drop down list appears, use the back arrow to get back to the main "Images" folder, select the "ANNOTATED" folder, then select your fish's folder. 

We hope people are able to evaluate these summaries, and evaluate how their interpretations match with others, whether it be confusion or trouble detecting certain features.  These generalized summaries provide a first step; more detailed and/or quantitative analysis of this data is possible. After review of this information, if people have specific interests to pursue that they can share that with the group.
