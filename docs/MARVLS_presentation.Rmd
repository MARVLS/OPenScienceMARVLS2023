## Am I qualified to give this presentation?

I would wager that this feeling is shared among most of us.   
The myths I tell myself:

* I am not a good enough coder

* I don't know github well enough

* There are errors in my analysis that will be discovered

* There are many NOAA policies and forms prevent me from joining in
