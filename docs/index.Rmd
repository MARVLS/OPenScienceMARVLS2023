## What & Why

--

What: 
Open and available science.

--

Why:

* Repeatable - future self and others

--

* Efficient - don't reinvent the wheel 

--

* Collaborative  - multiple people can work on the same documents and project

--

* Version control - can eliminate "doc_final_final.doc"

---

## Barriers to Entry

The myths I tell myself:
* I am not a good enough coder

* There are errors in my analysis that will be discovered

* I don't know the programs/github well enough

* NOAA policies prevent me from joining in -> actuality NOAA Open Science mandates

## Open Science State of Mind

* (Openscapes Slides) [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1giEW0EIYVnxneGpOBSJnEqg-1CVBUGrbH8Z5gawdeBc/edit#slide=id.p]

--

* Reframe your work as a collaborative effort not a individual burden 

--

* Redefine collaborators & community – Future You, Future Us            
 - New perspectives, tools, methods, ideas, colleagues, allies
 
--

* Reimagine challenges – expect there is a better way           
 - Reuse not reinvent: reduce lonely struggles & cognitive load
 
--

* Open as a daily practice - efficient, collaborative, inclusive, kind            
 - Share imperfect work, have empathy, learn & teach together          
 - Requires trust and time: slow down to speed up

## Discussion Prompts

* Is there an openscience standard or best practices for life history and reproductive biology?

* What changes are you seeing in our discipline?

* How do we (MARVLS) share and work together currently?

* How can we improve sharing and learning as a group?

* What are your barriers and is there something as a group we can do?
